LinnStrument - Custom Profiles
============
This is a custom firmware for the linnstrument that can be used to run custom note scales and spacings.

Up to 15 note profiles can be accessed from the octave/transpose settings screen and the plan is to have all the
existing linnstrument features like splits, transposition, etc to function as expected.

This is still under development, but if you would like to create your own note profiles and use this firmware,
open file "ls_profiles.h" to see the steps involved.

"ls_led_profiles" can also be used to customise the lighting for each profile, but it isn't confirmed to work
yet.

============

This is custom firmware for LinnStrument, running on an Arduino Due processor.

These sources assume that you're using Arduino IDE v1.8.1 with SAM boards v1.6.11.
Different versions of this package might create unknown build and execution problems.
